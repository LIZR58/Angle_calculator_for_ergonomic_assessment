# Calculator_for_risk_assessment
An automatic and improved calculator for ergonomic risk assessment contains six critical segments, including (1)Trunk, (2)Neck, (3)Legs, (4)Upper_arms, (5)Lower_arms, and (6)Wrists.

Under the abovementioned segments, this ergonomic calculator considers the 17 submodules listed below: Trunk_flexion_angle, Trunk_bending_angle, Trunk_twisting_angle, Neck_flexion_angle, Neck_bending_angle, Relative_height_difference_between_feet, Left_leg_flexion_angle, Right_leg_flexion_angle, Left_upper_arm_flexion_angle, Right_upper_arm_flexion_angle, Left_upper_arm_abduction_angle, Right_upper_arm_abduction_angle, Raising_gap_between_shoulders, Left_lower_arm_flexion_angle, Right_lower_arm_flexion_angle, Left_wrist_flexion_angle, Right_wrist_flexion_angle.

In addition, this calculator is developed for ergonomic assessment under the REBA (Rapid Entire Body Assessment) framework by Sue Hignett in 2000 (https://doi.org/10.1016/S0003-6870(99)00039-3). In specific, the calculation process is based on the 20-nodes joints system of skeleton data in CML (Construction Motion Data Library), which is a public and integrated motion dataset for on-site activity. This image from https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01841-1 demonstrates the skeletal body joints model and corresponding simplified 15/20 joints system.

The CML dataset contains skeleton data highly related to construction industries among the four fundamental categories of activities: Production Activities(12 types), Unsafe Activities(38 types), Awkward Activities(10 types), and Common Activities(13 types). The CML database can be download from the website below: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Construction_Motion_Data_Library_An_Integrated_Motion_Dataset_for_On-Site_Activity_Recognition/20480787/3. You can find out the folder "20_nodes" from the first zip "Construction_Related_Data" for use.
